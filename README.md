The World Bank Global Education Analysis EDA project was conducted to gain insights into the current state of education across the globe. 

We analyzed various factors, including enrollment rates, literacy levels, government spending, and education quality indicators

The project aimed to identify trends, challenges, and potential opportunities for policymakers and stakeholders to enhance education outcomes.

**Data Collection and Analysis:**
To conduct our analysis, we collected a comprehensive dataset from various sources, including national education databases, international organizations, and surveys.

We cleaned and processed the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, we examined the relationships and patterns within the data to draw meaningful insights.
